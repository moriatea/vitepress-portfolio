## Hi, I'm Gwendolin 👋

I'm a **product manager**, **strategist**, and **cross-functional collaborator** dedicated to building digital products that solve real user problems.

I'm currently a **Senior Product Manager, Group Digital Platforms** at [FWD Insurance](https://www.fwd.com.sg/), where I drive innovation in digital platforms and lead strategic initiatives that enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency.

Previously, I was a **Product Manager** at [Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/), where I led cross-functional product strategy and spearheaded features that significantly improved user engagement and business metrics. Before that, I spent over two years as a **Technical Product Owner** at [Amadeus](https://www.amadeus.com/), designing key features and UI enhancements for their Airport Management Suite. My career began in product and business analysis at [Atos Information Technology](https://atos.net/), where I managed full-lifecycle content management applications for government agencies.

I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Information Systems Management** with a Second Major in **Operations Management** from [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), equipping me with a strong foundation in both technology and business operations.

Seasoned professional with over 10 years under my belt, I specialize in **strategy**, **product feature development**, and **end-to-end project delivery**. I've honed my ability to collaborate seamlessly with cross-functional and country teams, ensuring smooth operations and successful outcomes across diverse markets and organizational structures.

My sweet spot? **Building features that users truly need**, not just what they want. I take pride in being a well-rounded individual, blending technical prowess with a deep understanding of UX, analytics, and the broader business context. Whether I'm analyzing user behavior, architecting product solutions, or aligning stakeholders around a shared vision, I'm driven by the goal of creating meaningful impact through thoughtful product decisions.
